# About me

I'm currently a postdoctoral research associate in mathematics at the University of Toronto, working in dynamical systems and ergodic theory. My mentor is [Professor Jacopo De Simoi](https://www.math.toronto.edu/jacopods/).

I was previously a PhD student at the University of Warwick under the supervision of [Professor Ian Melbourne](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/ian_melbourne/). A copy of my PhD thesis can be found [here](https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/181829/).
